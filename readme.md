## Setting Up For Redux
- First understanding updation **mutating way** and **non mutating way**.

- React doesn't understands the update when object is updated using **mutating way** because refrence still remains the same.
- How **state** is updated in **redux** using `function` known as **reducers**. These are plain functions but since they update **redux state** therefore they are known as **reducers**.
- The **state** and **action** parameters passed to reducer function
- What actually is **action** object and its properties with few conventions
